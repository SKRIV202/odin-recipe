    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This sandwich takes inspiration from the classic French steak, frites, and sauce pairing, turning it into a handheld version of a bistro favorite. The centerpiece is a rich peppercorn sauce made with two types of peppercorns, giving it both depth and heat. Part of the sauce is blended into a smooth mayonnaise that coats the sandwich, while the rest is served on the side, echoing the style of a French dip.</p>
    <p>The result is indulgent yet practical — all the flavor of a steakhouse meal in a form that’s easy to enjoy anywhere. The creamy peppercorn mayo complements the juicy steak perfectly, while the extra sauce makes every bite richer. It’s satisfying, flavorful, and even better when you use the leftover sauce for dipping your chips.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>1 sirloin steak</li>
  <li>1 tbsp of vegetable oil, or groundnut oil</li>
  <li>4 tbsp of mayonnaise</li>
  <li>1 baguette, halved widthways to make 2 lengths</li>
  <li>1 tbsp of Dijon mustard</li>
  <li>flaky sea salt</li>
  <li>250g of Golden Kings potatoes, or King Edward potatoes</li>
  <li>Vegetable oil, for deep-frying</li>
  <li>1 1/2 tsp black peppercorns</li>
  <li>1 1/2 tsp white peppercorns</li>
  <li>25g of butter</li>
  <li>2 shallots, finely diced</li>
  <li>100ml of red wine</li>
  <li>1 dash of Worcestershire sauce</li>
  <li>200ml of beef stock</li>
  <li>100ml of double cream</li>
</ul>
<h1>Steps:</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Peel and slice the potatoes into thin chips – around 1cm thickness. Place into a bowl and cover with cold water. Soak the chips for at least a couple of hours, to remove starch and ensure a crispy result</li>
    <li>To make the peppercorn sauce, transfer one third of the peppercorns to a pestle and mortar and crush them roughly</li>
    <li>Melt the butter in a frying pan and add the shallots and all the peppercorns. Cook until the shallots have softened but not coloured</li>
    <li>Add the red wine and let it bubble down until reduced by half</li>
    <li>Add the Worcestershire sauce and stock and reduce by half again</li>
    <li>Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the cream. Check the seasoning and add salt if necessary, then cover and set aside</li>
    <li>Next, cook the steak. Heat a heavy based frying pan or griddle over a high heat</li>
    <li>Rub the steak lightly with oil and season very well with flaky sea salt</li>
    <li>Once the pan is very hot, add the steak - it should sizzle and smoke dramatically (you might want to open a window at this point!)</li>
    <li>Cook for a minute or two each side - the exact cooking time will depend on the thickness and shape of your steak. For medium rare meat, a probe thermometer should read 52ºC when inserted into the thickest part of the steak</li>
    <li>Once cooked to your liking, remove the steak from the pan and set aside to rest while you cook the fries</li>
    <li>Heat oil for deep-frying to a temperature of 140ºC. Cook the fries for around 6 minutes, or until they are a light golden colour and a little crispy</li>
    <li>Drain on kitchen paper</li>
    <li>Increase the temperature of the oil to 180ºC, then fry the fries a second time, until golden brown and crisp - this will only take a couple of minutes. Drain on kitchen paper once more</li>
    <li>Make the peppercorn sauce mayo by combining 2 tablespoons of the peppercorn sauce with the mayonnaise and mixing well</li>
    <li>Tip any resting juices from the steak into the remaining peppercorn sauce and gently reheat it, then tip into a small serving dish</li>
    <li>To assemble the sandwiches, slice the baguette lengths and spread one side with mustard and the other with the peppercorn sauce mayo</li>
    <li>Top with sliced steak and a generous handful of fries, then close the sandwiches and serve the remaining sauce on the side, for dipping</li>
</ol>
